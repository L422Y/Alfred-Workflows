Simple workflow to be used with Airmail


###Compose new email

This will switch over to Airmail and open a compose window.


###Search Unified inbox

Switches to Airmails unified inbox and puts focus on the search field. The query copies to your clipboard
so you can paste it into the field. Thanks to [David Ferguson](http://www.alfredforum.com/user/10-david-ferguson/) in the Alfred 
forums for the help.

*Note:* If the search is currently active the search query wont trigger.

**To-do**
Write if statement to identify if Search field is active
